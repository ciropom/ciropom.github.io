I am an open-minded person, who likes to learn and be involved in challenging projects. 
I gained experience in many fields of Computer Science, some of them are embedded systems, low-level programming, formal verification (model checking), Machine Learning, real-Â­time applications, bio-Informatics, mesh networking and wireless sensor networks.

I'm currently a computer scientist in the field of Systems Biology and Systems Pharmacology at [COSBI](https://cosbi.eu/) where I implement software for AI-based and rule-based automatic knowledge extraction from scientific papers, data analysis, mathematical modelling and deterministic/stochastic simulation of biochemical reactions.
