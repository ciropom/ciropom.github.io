I just uploaded new pdfs for the talk I gave on the [Conference on Complex Systems 2016](http://www.ccs2016.org) in the Satellite Session on *Mathematical Pharmacology* as well as the Poster I presented on the [26th Page Meeting](https://www.page-meeting.org/default.asp?id=41&keuze=meeting).

Find them on on my [About](http://pascal.schulthess.io/about) page.
